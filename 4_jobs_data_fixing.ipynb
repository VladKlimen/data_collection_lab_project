We aren't flakes, nor do we seek chaos for chaos' sake.

This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day. We need people who can manage their own calendar and who aren't afraid to Google something if they don't know how to do it.

Please note, while we are a remote company, we are only able to employ individuals authorized to work in the United States.

As a bootstrapped, entrepreneurial-driven startup, there are many areas of the company where we're still \"building the rocket on the way up.\" So, if you require a tested and proven playbook to perform every aspect of your job, then this probably isn't the place for you</li><li>We work really, really hard. Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to achieve our \"comfortably-uncomfortable\" goals. While we DON'T believe in working weekends or pulling \"all-nighters\" as a normal course of business, if you want a cushy, 40-hour per week job, you probably won't like it here</li><li>We change our minds, pivot fast, and embrace change when change is needed. We aren't flakes, nor do we seek chaos for chaos' sake. But we WILL shift projects and priorities when presented with new data, so, again, if you need to work at a company that \"has it all figured out,\" we're not the place for you</li><li>We don't micro-manage. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day. We need people who can manage their own calendar and who aren't afraid to Google something if they don't know how to do it. In other words, if you need to know EXACTLY what you will be doing every hour of the day, week over week, we're probably not a good fit<br/><br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Benefits<br/><br/></strong><em><strong>Full-Time employees</strong></em><em> are eligible for health and welfare benefits.<br/><br/></em><ul><li>Competitive Salary: $100k+ OTE</li><li>Health, Dental, + Vision Insurance</li><li>HSA plan with Company Matching (for eligible HDHP enrollees)</li><li>Company-Paid Telemedicine Plan</li><li>Company-Paid Mental Wellness, Financial Wellness, + Legal Counseling services</li><li>Company-Paid Life Insurance</li><li>Unlimited PTO</li><li>401K Plan with Company Matching</li><li>Parental leave </li><li>Work station bonus <br/><br/></li></ul><em>Additional benefits:<br/><br/></em><ul><li>DigitalMarketer product access + annual membership</li><li>Emphasis on your learning and development</li><li>Virtual team building, game nights, social hours </li><li>Vibrant culture, community, and an excess of emojis... <br/><br/></li></ul>The Scalable Company provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.
